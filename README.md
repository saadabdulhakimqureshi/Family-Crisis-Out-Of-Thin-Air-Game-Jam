# Family-Crisis-Out-Of-Thin-Air-Game-Jam

Family Crisis is a strategy board game created for the OUT OF THIN AIR Game Jam hosted by Mindstorm Studios. The theme of the game jam was family planning and reproductive health.

Our game involves 2 or more families(player) going on a journey with random events that can be: 

1- A scenario where the family has to make a gut based decision to either spend their wealth for their benefit or keep it.
2- A interaction between different families.
3- A crisis that can harm the family.

The player that reaches the last cell stops the game and the family with most family stability coins wins. If a player loses all their money they are disqualified.

 # Family-Crisis-Out-Of-Thin-Air-Game-Jam

Family Crisis is a strategy board game created for the OUT OF THIN AIR Game Jam hosted by Mindstorm Studios. The theme of the game jam was family planning and reproductive health.


Our game involves 2 or more families(player) going on a journey with random events that can be: 

1- A scenario where the family has to make a gut based decision to either spend their wealth for their benefit or keep it.

2- A interaction between different families.

3- A crisis that can harm the family.


The player that reaches the last cell stops the game and the family with most family stability coins wins. If a player loses all their money they are disqualified.

The player starts at go and has to reach the last cell. When a player lands on an event they randomly choose the event from the jar. There is a check at cell 20 where the player either goes back to starting position if they havenâ€™t landed on at least one event or proceeds. If a player lands on booster they can get free family coins or money. Before landing on the last cell the player has a choice of going back to get more family coins which can be risky or ending the game. Who ever lands on the last cell ends the game.
